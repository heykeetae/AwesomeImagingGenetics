# Awesome Imaging Genetics

## Imaging Genetics
Imaging Genetics, i.e., Imaging Genomics or Radiogenomics, is a rapidly evolving field connecting the cellular genomics and medical image analysis. It primarily concerns tracking genetic variations from the imaging phenotype. Driven by recent advances in machine learning and active application of the algorithm, a host of novel research ideas have been brought into fruition. To highlight those efforts, the long-term goal of this repository is to list relevant research papers and summarize available public datasets.
