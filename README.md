# Awesome Imaging Genetics

## Imaging Genetics
Imaging Genetics, i.e., Imaging Genomics or Radiogenomics, is a rapidly evolving field connecting the cellular genomics and medical image analysis. I will interchangeably refer to the area in the three different names until a fixed standardized name is agreed among scholars.  It primarily concerns tracking genetic variations from the imaging phenotype. Driven by recent advances in machine learning and active application of the algorithm, a host of novel research ideas have been brought into fruition. To highlight those efforts, the long-term goal of this repository is to list relevant research papers and summarize available public datasets.

The figure above illustrates the intuition of Imaging Genetics. We would like to trace genetic information underlying the patterns (or phenotype) found on medical images! (Don't be misguided, I do not claim that we can trace all the genetic mutations in a colorectal tissue as in the feagure, the figure is for illustrative purpose only.)
